# PushNotification-PWA
Project PWA. This is an application that contains a form that generates a message to send a push notification.

Hello everybody, this is a really mini project, to practice push notification in react. 

So, to init, you have to run "node index" inside to "server" folder (this is because, we need create a sever on port 8000), then, run normality the react app.

When you have already initialized the two ports, 3000 and 8000, within the application, send a message within the form. Then you will get a notification message from the browser. Please check that notifications are available.

If you have any questions, you can write to me at joedavidmr@gmail.com.
